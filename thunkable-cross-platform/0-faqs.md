#### How much does it cost to use Thunkable ✕? {#any-special-requirements-to-be-an-ios-developer-can-you-make-it-easier-for-new-developers}

Thunkable is free to use. Thunkable charges a maintenance fee for the use of certain components such as Ads by AdMob and Payment by Stripe.

**I am a Thunkable iOS user. What happened to the Thunkable iOS platform? Can I import my projects?**

Your projects have been automatically upgraded to Thunkable Cross Platform ✕ which works exactly like Thunkable iOS did but with the big added benefit of your projects working on Android devices. No importing is necessary and your Thunkable Live app should world with all your projects.

**I am a Thunkable Classic Android user. Can I import my projects?**

Thunkable Cross Platform ✕ was built completely redesigned from the ground up to give users a more modern, intuitive and more efficient way to build apps leveraging the latest technologies.

Unfortunately, that means projects on Thunkable Android are not easily importable to ✕ and we recommend starting all projects from scratch. You will notice that there are also some components that are not yet available on ✕ \(we are working on adding more soon\) and also some that are available only on ✕. You will also notice that some key tasks like live testing, downloading, exporting and sharing projects have also been updated.
