# Get Started

![Goal 1: Preview your own app on your device on the Thunkable Live app](../../.gitbook/assets/live-test%20%281%29.png)

{% tab title="Instructions" %}
**Building your first app on Thunkable is an adventure** and we have a number of resources, a [wonderful community](https://community.thunkable.com/c/thunkable-cross), and an energetic beaver to help you find your way.

**Goal**: If this is your first time with us, we think a good first goal is to preview an app that you have built or customized on your own phone or tablet. It's a pretty exciting moment and it might even get you to leap out of your chair. Feel free to [tweet to us](https://twitter.com/thunkable?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) about it when you do!

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes \(grab yourself a nice beverage\)

### Login to the Thunkable platform [here](https://x.thunkable.com/)

At the moment, the only way to login is with your Google account. We are working on adding add'l login options.

If you are having login issues, please take a look at this [troubleshooting](../create/login-issues.md) document.  It is most likely related to enabling cookies and disabling ad blockers.

### Download and login to the Thunkable Live app\(s\)

You can find the Thunkable Live app by searching on the App or Play Store or by clicking the links below:

If you don't have an iOS or Android device, you can also [set up an emulator](emulators.md) on your computer that will mimic what you would see on an actual device.

### [Start with a tutorial](tutorials.md) to familiarize yourself with the platform

We have tutorials built into the left panel of our platform and we are working on adding a collection of video tutorials if that is more of your speed.

Some things you'll want to learn how to do:

* Change your [app name and icon](../create/app-icon-+-name.md)
* Drag and drop a component like a [button](../create/components/user-interface/button.md) into your project
* Change the [color](../create/components/user-interface/button.md#style-the-button), [size](../create/intro-to-sizing.md) or [position](../create/intro-to-spacing.md) of your button
* [Preview](../live-test.md#live-preview) your changes in your app

### Get inspired with a [sample app](sample-apps.md)

You will find three beginner sample apps when you login or you can remix from our growing collection of sample apps. Thunkable is working on building the largest collection of public mobile app projects in the world.

Sample apps range from beginner to advanced and the more advanced ones may require some extra work to view on your device.

You may also want to take a look at our design templates for some added inspiration.
