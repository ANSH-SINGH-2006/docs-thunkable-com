## Visible Components

Visible components have common sets of properties usually sizing, styling & text styling, spacing, positioning. You may often have multiple visible components on a single screen and sometimes dozens if not hundreds in a single app.

## Invisible or API Components

Invisible components often require some set-up and usually are limited to one type of invisible component per app \(since you do not need to add them across screens
