In most apps, one event leads to another event if a condition is met. To specify these scenarios, the `this`, do `that` block is commonly used with [Logic](logic.md) blocks that define the conditions that lead one event to the next.

The if `this`, do `that` block can be transformed to support more complex logic

A user can open an app installed on their phone by clicking a deep link either for Android and iOS. To find deep links for commonly installed apps, you can use this helpful site for social media apps called [URL genius](https://app.urlgeni.us/#/).

You can also use this block to open a URL in the browser.
