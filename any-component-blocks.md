# "Any Component" Blocks

## **What is the Generic Event Block?**

With the Generic Event block, you can change properties \(such as the ****text and color\) of any component in your app. 

For example, in the picture below, any button you click on the screen will change the text of Label1 to be “Thunking Is Fun!”.

## **Using the Generic Event Block**

With the first dropdown menu, you can select what type of component you want to change the properties for.

With the second dropdown menu, you can choose when the changes to the properties will occur.

## **The Component Item Block**

If you want to customize a button that you clicked on the screen, you can use this block.

![](.gitbook/assets/create-example%20%286%29.png)

With the blocks below, anytime a button is clicked, the text of that button will be set to “I Love Thunkable!”.

![Anytime a button is clicked, the text of that button will be set to &#x201C;I Love Thunkable!&#x201D;.](.gitbook/assets/generic-method-block%20%281%29.gif)

## **What is the Create Block?**

This might sound repetitive, but the create block is a way to program your app to create visible components \(things you can see--like button or images\).

When you use the create block, your app will automatically create something. For example:

This picture shows that when Screen1 Opens, your app will create a button and put it on Screen1.

## **Using the Create Block**

With the first dropdown menu, you can select what type of visible component you want to create. 

![](.gitbook/assets/create-example%20%284%29.png)

With the second dropdown menu, you can select where you want to position the component you are creating on the app’s screen. 

_**Notes: The options in the third drop down will vary depending on which component you select from the first dropdown.**_  
  
****The following block creates a new button and places it as the first item on Screen1.

The table below explains the different block options:

| **Property** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **As first in** | **This creates and positions the component as the first item in the specified row, column or screen.** |
| **As last in** | **This creates and positions the component as the last item in the specified row, column or screen.** |
| **Before** | **This creates and positions the component before the component selected in the third dropdown menu.** |
| **After** | **This creates and positions the component before the component selected in the third dropdown menu.** |

## **The Component Item Block**

![](.gitbook/assets/create-example%20%285%29.png)

If you want to customize the component you just created, you can use this block. 

![](.gitbook/assets/create-example%20%283%29.png)

These blocks say, when any button on the screen1 is clicked, create a new button. Next, set the new button’s text to “I was just created!”. 

![When any button on the screen is clicked, a new button is created at the top of the screen.](.gitbook/assets/create-block.gif)

## **What is the Clone Block?**

The clone block makes a copy of an existing component in your app. For example, if you have a button on your screen and want to create another button that looks exactly the same, you can use the clone block to do that.

You can use the clone block instead of repeatedly using the same combination of blocks. This will also help you use less blocks.  

_Note: You cannot clone screens and invisible components with the clone block.

## **Using the Clone Block**
