# Push Notifications by One Signal

![One Signal is the world leader in push notifications and they offer their service for free. They make money by selling your users&apos; data to third parties](.gitbook/assets/onesignaldemo.png)

Push notifications are one of the biggest advantages that mobile apps have over their mobile website counterparts since they can send a message to a user without an app being open. However, annoying notifications, those that are irrelevant and too frequent, can be dismissed our block easily so we highly recommend sending notifications only when the content is relevant to the user.

**Push Notifications are a**  ![](.gitbook/assets/pro.png) **component.** While all Thunkers can add Push Notifications to their app projects and live test them in their apps, only PRO Thunkers can download and publish apps with Push Notifications.

Most of the work you do to use push notifications in your app will be on the One Signal interface. On Thunkable, you simply drag and drop the component in and add the One Signal Android and/or iOS key\(s\).
