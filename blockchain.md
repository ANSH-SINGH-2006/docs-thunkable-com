# -----Blockchain-----

## Blockchain Basics

A blockchain is a public ledger of information collected through a network. Blockchain technology is not a company, nor is it an app, but rather an entirely new way of documenting data on the internet. The technology can be used to develop blockchain applications, such as social networks, messengers, games, exchanges, storage platforms, voting systems, prediction markets, online shops and much more. 

## Oasis Labs and Thunkable

To help get you started incorporating blockchain technology into your apps, we've created both video tutorials and text walkthroughs for 3 sample apps. You can also find full documentation for the [OasisWeb3](https://docs.thunkable.com/~/drafts/-L_K4CA6uUkORsL2uJoM/primary/oasisweb3) and [OasisSmartContract](https://docs.thunkable.com/~/drafts/-L_K4CA6uUkORsL2uJoM/primary/oasissmartcontract) components.

**We appreciate your feedback during this Beta launch. Please feel free to let us know your thoughts with this** [**survey**](https://anne577751.typeform.com/to/QAqsRp)**.**

## Scavenger Hunt -- Creating and utilizing coins with the Blockchain 

The “Scavenger Hunt” app allows you to create a “geo hotspot” on a map . When the user is within the geo hotspot, they can click on the “Unlock Location” button to receive a Hunt Token. Hunt Tokens \(and other tokens\) are created on the Oasis Blockchain. 

You can easily customize this app by changing the geo hotspot area that can give you coins when you are within its boundaries.
