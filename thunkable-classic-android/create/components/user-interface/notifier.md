# Notifier

### ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/notifier-icon.png)

Notifiers come in two flavors - alerts, which are more passive but whose appearance can be customized and dialogs which default to the Material Design design but prompt users to confirm \(Message Dialog\), make a choice \(Choose Dialog\), enter text \(Text Dialog\) or wait \(Progress Dialog\) for a certain event before proceeding.
