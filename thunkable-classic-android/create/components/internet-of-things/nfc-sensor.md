# NFC Sensor

### ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/nfc-icon.png)

The NFC Sensor included in many phones is used to most commonly to enable tap and pay services like Apple and Android Pay. NFC tags, which require no power, are embedded not just in phones but in transit cards, laundry buttons and an increasing number of objects.

If available on the device, the NFC component supports the reading and writing of NFC text tags that have been embedded in another object only. If you don't have them already, you will need to procure readable and writable NFC tags.

The component will only also work on Screen1.
