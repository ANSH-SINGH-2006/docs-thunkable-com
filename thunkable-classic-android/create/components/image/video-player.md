# Video Player

###  ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/video-player-icon.png)

If your media files are too large, you may get errors when packaging or installing your application, in which case you should reduce the number of media files or their sizes

If you want to avoid the video format size limit, you can also set the media source to a URL that points to a streaming video, but the URL must point to the video file itself, not to a program that plays the video.
