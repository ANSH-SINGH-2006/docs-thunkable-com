# Text to Speech

###  ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/text-to-speech-icon.png)

You can also change the pronunciation of words \(not the actual language spoken\) by supplying a language or country code. For example, setting the language to French and speaking English text will sound like someone speaking English \(en\) with a French accent. Setting the country code to British English \(GBR\) will sound different from US English \(USA\) and not every country code will affect every language

The languages and countries available depend on the particular device, and can be listed with the Available Languages and Available Countries properties.

The Text to Speech component is used in the sample app [ThunkableChat: Chat with Instant Translation](https://www.gitbook.com/book/albertching/thunkable-docs/edit#)
