# â†— Components

Components are the building blocks of apps. They can be visible on your screen or work in the background. They can leverage the native capabilities of your phone or connect you to one of your favorite 3rd party services. In short, they are powerful and essential-- so start drag and dropping them to your app, customize them and program them to do \(almost\) anything you want.
