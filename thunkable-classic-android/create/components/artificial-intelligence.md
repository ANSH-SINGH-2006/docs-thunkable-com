Artificial intelligence is the idea and fast-charging reality that computers will be able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

So that we can all get ahead of the machines, the Thunkable platform already features a number of components that are powered by the latest in artificial intelligence available today -- with many more to come in the future
