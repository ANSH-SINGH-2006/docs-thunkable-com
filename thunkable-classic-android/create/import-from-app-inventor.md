Select "App \(save .apk to my computer\)." A pop-up box \(seen below\) should alert you that your download has begun. Note: The other option \(provide QR code for .apk\) produces a scannable QR code that will download the app for two hours. You can share this code with others, but they have to use it within 2 hours of your generating it.
